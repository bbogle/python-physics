Physics Engine Written In Python

This is a simple 2D ridgid body physics engine,
made using the pygame (http://www.pygame.org) library
to power the graphics.

To run the demo, simply run:
$ python main.py

The current implementation only supports circles. There
can be universal gravity or per object gravity. Ball
collisions are done with subdevided time to maintain realism.
Hard walls can also be set up at arbitrary angles.

main.py contains all the setup to generate the window,
and the main game loop to draw the active objects.
This loop is meant to contol the game. It makes the
calls to the game objects's move() and draw() functions,
as well as approrpiatly calling the function sto check
for and react to collisions.

Vector.py contains only the Vector class. This is a simple
implementation of a two dimentional vector, with elements
x and y. It also has methods for extracting the magnitude
and direction of the vector.

GalaxyParts.py contains all the objects and specific physics
for the simulation. Eventually, I would like to move all the
physics related parts to Physics.py.

Physics.py is meanst to encapsulate all the physics calculations.
So far it doesn't contain much.
