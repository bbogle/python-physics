Physics Engine Written In Python

This is a simple 2d ridgid body physics engine.
I am using the pygame (http://www.pygame.org) library
to power the graphics.

To run the demo, simply run:
$ python main.py

main.py contains all the setup to generate the window,
and the main game loop to draw the active objects.
This loop is meant to contol the game. It makes the 
calls to the game objects's move() and draw() functions,
as well as approrpiatly calling the function sto check
for and react to collisions.
    
Vector.py contains only the Vector class. This is a simple
implementation of a two dimentional vector, with elements
x and y. It also has methods for extracting the magnitude
and direction of the vector.

GalaxyParts.py contains all the objects and specific physics
for the simulation. Eventually, I would like to move all the
physics related parts to Physics.py.
